Guess A Number is simple guessing game, where a player is supposed to guess the number that the computer has come up with. The computer will randomly choose a number between 0 and 100. After that the player has 10 tries to guess. Every time the player enters his guess, the computer will tell him whether it is higher or lower than the correct number.

The player will win the game, when his guess is the same as computer's.
The player will lose the game, if he did not succeed to guess the number in 10 tries.
